I believe the best way to learn is to teach. I'm currently building a series of public repositories to share my knowledge, starting from the fundamentals of web development.

* **(Coming Soon!) [web-dev-basics](https://github.com/ayoubabbadi/web-dev-basics)**: A complete guide to HTML, CSS, and the foundations of the web.
